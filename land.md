Raids cannot be paused. Cancelling them will have you lose your progress.

As of *Update 11*, raids have rarities based on your *Scout*

**Standard Raids**

These raids are always available. There are three of them which all reward gathering resources.

** Scouted Raids**

These are one-use raids, which go away upon completion or cancellation.
