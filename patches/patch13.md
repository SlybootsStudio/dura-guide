Gathering
---------

- Upgrade levels past 100 give +0.5% boost to the resource bonus from jewels and runes.
- Tool levels 16-20 now give +6% resources per level. 21-25 give +7% and 26-30 give +8%.
- T7-T9 runes now give +1.7%, +3.8% and +8.8% resources, up from +1.6%, 3.2% and 6.4%.
- The gathering level bonus for resources was increased slightly.
- Each gathering level after 100 gives a +0.4% chance for double gathering item drops. This rolls until failure, but the max modifier is currently x3. Eg at level 130 you have a 12% chance of getting double sandstone, and then a further 12% chance of getting 3x.

- Rubies, Birds Nests and Marble now start dropping at level 60.
- Gatherers lower than level 50 will now receive a resource drop of 140 + (level * 10).
- Since newer players will have less income due to the above changes, the costs of the first few tool levels were decreased: Levels 1-6 now cost 5/25/60/150/350/750 down from 10/30/75/175/350/750.
- The maximum level of gathering upgrades was increased to 500.

Clans

- Clan totems at levels 43 and above have had their cost curves adjusted. They now increase at a rate that is fixed at a ratio of approx 11.44:1 for gold:res. Previously the gold increased faster than the resources causing problems at around levels 50 and higher.
