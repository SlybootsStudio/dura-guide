[Patches](patches.md)

Land
----
- Personnel level cap increased to 150.
- Added a new bonus to each personnel at level 150.
- Scout level contributes slightly less to raid rarity upgrades, and scout rarity contributes slightly more.

Trinkets
--------
- Legendary trinkets now always contain base gold/res.
- Mythical trinkets now always contain base gold/res as well as gold boost/res boost.
- Trinkets can now drop whilst performing any crafting skill, and have an equal chance of dropping a battling/gathering trinket.

Items
-----
- Added Demonic Dust which is used to craft Ultra Exp Potions.
- Added a new Rune Belt level, requiring 375 Runic Leather.
- Removed Goblin Cave Key and Trinket Fragments from the Token Store.
- Decreased the cost of Runic Leather in the Token Store from 5,000 to 2,000 tokens.

Dungeoneering
-------------
- Added a new uncommon dungeon: Dragonkin Lair. Requires dungeoneering level 75.
- Added a new rare dungeon: Hall Of Dragons. Requires dungeoneering level 75.

Gathering
---------
- Exp bonuses during gathering events increased to 50/100/150/200/300/400%, from 25/50/100/200/300/400%.
- You can now use a single resource to upgrade your gathering upgrade level at a 10% higher price. Eg if it cost 100k of each resource, using a single resource would cost 330k.

Jewelcrafting
-------------
- Perfect craft chance increased which essentially gives everyone +2 jewelcrafting levels to their perfect craft chance.
- The way the perfect chance is calculated at lower levels was changed so that low level jewelcrafting is not a complete waste of time:
-- If we assume each jewelcrafting level previously gave +1 perfect craft chance, you now gain +0.5 per level but start at +50.
-- This means that Jewelcrafting level 1 is the same as level 50 previously. Level 50 now is the same as the old level 75. Level 90 now is the same as the old level 95. From level 100 onwards the chances increase as they did previously.

Alchemy
-------
- Ultra Exp Potion added. Increases exp gained by 50% for 400 actions and requires level 75 alchemy to craft. Requires 25 tree sap and 1 demonic dust.
- Minor autos potions and aptitude potions now require 6 tree sap to craft, up from 1.
- Greater exp potions now require 6 tree sap to craft, up from 1.
- Heroic potions now require 25 tree sap, up from 10.

Events
------
- Bosses now drop 5 boss tokens upon reaching 100m damage. They increase again at 200m, 400m, 700m, 1.1b. They used to drop 5 at 125m and increase again at 250m, 500m, 1b.
- Boss spawn chance increased by 5%.
- Gathering event spawn chance increased by 5%.
