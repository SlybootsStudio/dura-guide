Bonus Time
----------

- Bonus Exp/Bonus Gold/Bonus Resources was combined into "Bonus Time" which is a single instance giving all 3 bonuses.
- Bonus Time now comes with a modifier which increases as more bonus time is credited. The starting value is 25% and increases by 1% after certain time thresholds.
NOTE: The modifier depends on the total amount of bonus time since the current period was initiated. The modifier resets when bonus time expires. For example, after a $20 purchase (26% modifier), and with 1 minute remaining, a second player makes a $25 purchase, the modifier increases to 27%.
- Nobility ranks now give an additional 1% bonus per rank.

Honor Tokens
------------

- Honor Tokens can be exchanged for Honor at a rate of 10:1, and can be traded on the Market.
- When making a purchase, you receive 1 Honor Token for every $1 spent. You still receive 100% of the Honor from the purchase.

Gathering
---------

- Decreased the variance between resource gains by increasing the minimum roll and decreasing the maximum roll.
- From tool level 12 onwards, each tool level now gives a higher rate of resources.
- Each level past level 100 gives a bonus to the gathering boost from tools/jewels/runes. Starting at 0.3% per level, increasing exponentially. Examples: Level 150: +17%, Level 200: 38.8%, Level 250: 66.3%, Level 500: 338.2%.
- At certain upgrade levels, you have a chance at double shards: 100: 10%, 150: 20%, 200: 35%, 250: 55%, 300: 80%.
- The "Resources" gathering upgrade was reduced from +1% per level to +0.5% per level, but separated out onto a new multiplication stack.

--------

- Added a new area: Draconic Isles
- Slightly reduced the gold from the final few mobs in The Underworld.
