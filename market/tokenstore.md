# Token Store

> Patch 10 made changes to the token store and dungeoneering tokens. The 6th Rune slot was added, which created renewed demand for Runic Leather, the price of which was drastically reduced in the token store. Acquisition of boss tokens was also changed to be more favorable to help support this change.
>
> As of 1/26/2021, the Runic Leather cost should be considered unstable, as the patch was just released on this day and the market remains unsettled.

## Boss Tokens

### Acquiring

You get boss tokens only from fighting global bosses (appearing in the right-hand column). After 100,000 total boss damage you'll start to earn tokens. You get 1 token for a miss, and multiple tokens for a hit (depending on total boss damage).

| Total Boss Damage | Boss Tokens
| ----------------- | -----------
| < 100,000 | 0
| < 10m | 2
| 10m+ | 3
| 50m+ | 4
| 100m+ | 5
| 200m+ | 6
| 400m+ | 7
| 700m+ | 8
| 1b+ | 9

## Jewel Slots

`Dungeoneering Tokens` from completing [Dungeons](#dungeons.md).

> **New players** Dungeon Keys can be a good source of gold income early on, but they are also a good source of tool, weapon, and armor components as well as alchemy ingredients. Most importantly, they are your **only** source of `dungeoneering tokens` which you need for jewel slots. Gatherers and battlers benefit from jewels.
>
> Using dungeon keys is also the only way to raise your dungeoneering level which unlocks more valuable types of keys.
