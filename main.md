## Author Bias

Advice on this site is given by Tempest, unless otherwise stated. I am not a "top player" focused on maximizing income-per-action, which is what many players of incremental and PBBG games are trying to achieve. I am casual player focusing on gatherer, crafting, and enjoying my experience in the game.

This web site is maintained independently by players, and we give a huge thanks to our contributors.
