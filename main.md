## Author Bias

Advice on this site is given by Tempest, unless otherwise stated. I am not a "top player" focused on maximizing income-per-action, which is what many players of incremental and PBBG games are trying to achieve. I am a gatherer, and crafter, and my experience in the game is primarily in those skills, not battling.
