# Beginner's Guide

Welcome to Idle Quest RPG (IQRPG)!

This guide serves to direct new players in the right direction. This is a work in progress and more info will be gradually added.

## Quick guide

1. Choose a main skill and stick with it.
2. Get to land 3.
3. Progress and increase your income.

## Choosing your main skill

- You have 4 options to choose from. Mining, Woodcutting, Quarrying, and Battling.
- The general consensus is that **all 4 skills are pretty equal**. You will want to only pick one skill to main, and never touch the other ones. Why?
    - You will progress and make much more gold than if you level all skills equally. However, you should play the game however you want. Don't let anyone tell you how to have fun. Just know that you could be hindering your own (or your clan's) progress.
- You will buy/trade for the other resources via market.

### Skills

Some quick info about each skill that might help you decide which to choose:

- **Mining** drops gems and gem fragments. These can be crafted into jewels through the `Crafting>Jewelcrafting` tab.
- **Woodcutting** drops alchemy ingredients. These can be crafted into potions through the `Crafting>Alchemy` tab.
- **Quarrying** drops stones. These can be crafted into runes through the `Crafting>Runecrafting` tab.
- **Battling** has less drops than the others. It compensates by generating gold directly, and arguably scales better than the others in the long-term.

> Do note that just because you pick a tradeskill, you do not have to perform its respective crafting skill. You can buy and sell whatever you want from the market.

You might also want to check market prices to see which resource/drop is worth the most (`sapphires`, `tree saps`, `sandstone`, etc.). Prices fluctuate though.

> **Once again, all 4 skills are pretty balanced. Just pick one and stick to it.**
