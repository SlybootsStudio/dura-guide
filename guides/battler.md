# Battling Guide

## Quick guide

- Upgrade equipment and boosts
- Move up mobs
- Repeat.

## Premium store

- gold > attri/drop > exp > mastery
- Attri vs drop is depending on how much income/xtrade you have

## Attributes

- Attack > Health/Defence > Accuracy/Dodge

## Masteries

- Gold rush >>> Damage > Damage Reduction > Accuracy/Dodge
- (keep gold rush 100 above others)

## Equipment ratio

Early to mid-game, keep weapons 10 levels above armor. Late game, have weapons and armor at equal levels.

If the component cost is slightly higher than the gold cost of one level, upgrade type. Otherwise upgrade level.

In other words, upgrade types to keep the costs between type/level equal.

## Trinkets

Base gold > gold boost > attribute boost > stats

## Main ways to improve income

### Simplified gold formula

$\text{gold per action} = \text{base} * (1 + \text{boost}$)

Therefore you want to maximize base gold and gold boost.

### Gold boost

- Premium store
- Clan
- Land
- Heroic pots

### Base gold

Stronger stats = higher mobs

- Higher mobs
- Equipment
- Jewels
- Runes

### Base gold vs gold boost

Base gold is almost always better than gold boost. You will often have more gold boost than base gold, which means that an increase to base gold will boost your income more.

- For example, let's say I have `100 base gold`, and `200% gold boost`. That means my gold/action is `300`.
- If I increase **base gold** by `1`, then my gold/action increases to `303`.
- If I increase my **gold boost** by `1`, then my gold/action only increases to `301`.
- As you can see, base gold > gold boost.

## Misc FAQ

### What is armor cap?

You can only reduce incoming damage to 20%. After that, nothing happens no matter how much more defense/armor you stack.

Armor cap exists because otherwise you'd just go all in on armor and go fight big mobs and be immortal.

You know you've hit armor cap when you upgrade armor and damage you take doesn't seemingly change. (RNG still exists)
