## General strategy

- Upgrade equipment and boosts.
- Move up mobs.
- Repeat.

## Attributes

Attack will be your most important, primary attribute.

Secondary attributes are Health and Defence.

Tertiary attributes are Accuracy and Dodge.

## Masteries

Gold Rush will be your most important, primary mastery.

Secondary masteries are Damage and Damage Reduction.

Tertiary masteries are Accuracy and Dodge.

When you join a clan, or in anticipation of joining a clan, clanmanship will be important because it's a way to generate resources for your clan.

## Equipment

Upgrade types or level based on cost. One uses gold and the other uses components (which can easily be converted to a gold cost). Upgrade whichever is more affordable.

In general, you'll keep your weapons and armor roughly the same levels.

## Trinkets

Trinkets will appear mid-game, more often as you your battling skill nears level 100.

The attributes you want on your trinkets are (in order of importance)

1. base gold
1. gold boost
1. attribute boost
1. stats

Don't upgrade a trinket which doesn't have base gold or gold boost. Wait for a better trinket.

## Premium store

Eventually you'll get to boosts in the premium store. You can use credits or bound credits. Crosstrading (xtrading) can help free-to-play players accomplish these goals. Focus on maxing a boost completely before moving on.

It takes 3150 credits to max a boost.

Gold boost is most important.

Attribute and battling experience are next.

Drop and mastery boost should be last.


## Main ways to improve income

### Simplified gold formula

> gold per action = base \* boost \* gold from mobs \%

Therefore you want to maximize `base gold`, `gold boost`, and `gold from mobs %`.

### Base gold

- Higher mobs (requires stronger stats)
    - Equipment
    - Jewels
    - Runes
    - Clan
    - Upgrade stones (health/damage)
- Trinkets

### Gold boost

- Premium store
- Trinkets
- Clan

### Gold from mobs %

This multiplier is actually pretty good once you max premium gold boost.

- Land
- Heroic pots

### Base Gold vs Gold Boost

Base gold is almost always better than gold boost. You will often have more gold boost than base gold, which means that an increase to base gold will increase your income more.

- For example, let's say I have `100 base gold`, and `200% gold boost`. That means my gold/action is `300`.
- If I increase **base gold** by `1`, then my gold/action increases to `303`.
- If I increase my **gold boost** by `1`, then my gold/action only increases to `301`.
- As you can see, base gold > gold boost.

## Misc

### How to calculate my Power level?

> NEEDS REVISITING

### Detailed gold formula

> NEEDS REVISITING

> (mob+base) \* (1 + gold boost) \* (1 + gold from mobs)

- where mob is the mob you are fighting
- base is base gold from trinkets
- gold boost is premium + trinket + clan
- gold from mobs is land + heroic

### What does battling level do?

> NEEDS REVISITING

- Each battling level gives you more hp.
- "Battling levels over 100 now contribute towards gold gains. Each level has an exponential increase, starting at 0.22% at level 101, rising to 6% at level 120, 23.6% at level 150, 100% at level 200. This is a direct modifier, multiplying gold after all other calculations." ([Update 11](patches/patch11.md))

### What is armor cap?

> NEEDS REVISITING

You can only reduce incoming damage to 20%. After that, nothing happens no matter how much more defense/armor you stack.

Armor cap exists because otherwise you'd just go all in on armor and go fight big mobs and be immortal.

You know you've hit armor cap when you upgrade armor and damage you take doesn't seemingly change. (RNG still exists)
