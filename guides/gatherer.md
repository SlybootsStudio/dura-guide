# Gatherer Guide

## Quick guide

- Upgrade tool and boosts.
- Repeat.

## Premium store

- res boost = drop boost > exp > mastery
- Max each boost before moving on to the next

## Gathering upgrades

If noob:

- res% > exp > double drop > res rush

If not noob, then pick one of these. Both are good.

- res% = exp > res rush > double drop > rarity
- res% > exp = res rush > double drop > rarity

## Masteries

- Gathering equal with [mining OR woodcut OR quarry]
- Once you find a clan, clanmanship should be on par with gathering. Assuming you're not in a dead clan. Consult with your clan regarding donations, rushes, etc.

## Trinkets

Exp > double drop > mastery > rarity
