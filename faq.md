# FAQ

### How do I get XXX?

`market`.

### How do I make more gold?

- Sell your drops! These include keys, stones, gems, ingredients, and tool/weapon/armor components. As a newbie you will not have much use for them. Obviously if you need the components to improve your main skill then don't sell them.
- Pay IRL $$$
- X-trade in from other games.
- I won't lie to you, the early game is tough. It takes a bit of gold to make more gold. Stick to it and you'll slowly progress. It's an idle game after all. Marathon, not a sprint.

### Why is this item so expensive?

If you are patient, set up a buy order instead of immediately buying it at its selling price.

### Why can’t I equip this jewel?

You have to unlock the jewel slot. `market`>`token store`>`jewel slots`

### How do I join a clan? Why isn't anyone accepting me?

Advertise in /trade chat. Do note that clan spaces are expensive. Up your actions count and income. Don't give up!

### How do I get credits?

- `market`>`black market`. You can purchase about 75 bound credits before reaching market price. You will want to buy these each month before turning to the market. See [blackmarket](market/blackmarket.md) for more info.
- market. Current market price is about 2m gold each, give or take.
- \$$$

### How do I get more autos?

- Buying using creds `premium>autos`
- Clan
- Land

### How many autos should I buy?

Up to you. It depends on how often you refresh autos. The more autos you run each day, the faster you will progress.

Auto potions exist — but not profitable for most people.

### It says 15% component drop chance but I haven’t gotten a single drop!

Your actual drop rate is much lower (base of 1/100). A 15% component drop chance means that if you get a drop, there is a 15% chance that drop will be components.

### Best equipment ratio for battlers?

Keep equipment type equal. Early to midgame, keep weapons ~10 levels above armor. Late game, have weapons and armor at equal levels.

### How to decide whether to upgrade equipment type or level?

- If the component cost is slightly higher than the gold cost, upgrade type. Otherwise upgrade level.

### Should I "chop the spirit tree"? "quarry the sinkhole"? "mine the meteorite?”

Yes. These events have higher drop rates for tool comps and drops.

### How do I send stuff to other people?

- `Market > send items`
- Or double click on their name in chat and click “send items”.

### What are the rarities?

common ⇒ uncommon ⇒ rare ⇒ epic ⇒ legendary ⇒ mythical

### What is my power level?

The game does not tell you. But you do not need to know it. When battling, aim for 98%-99% win rate. Set it to a mob, clear your Action Tracker, and come back in a few minutes to see your win rate.

You are strong enough to clear a dungeon if you can defeat a mob of similar power level.

- For example, Mountain Dungeon mobs are power level 700. If you are able to defeat skeletal mages (powerlevel 770), you should be OK in the Mountain Dungeon.
