Trinkets are non-tradeable, upgradable, sets of buffs. You can equip 3 trinkets at a time. There are two types of trinkets, Gathering and Battling.

Players who battle and gather need to switch their trinkets when they switch their action types.

## Investment Strategy

Trinkets are items (and their components are resources) which are difficult to obtain because they are locked behind only a couple of expensive upgrades: Land, and Treasure Hunter. Increasing your trinket drop chance and having high daily actions is the best way to accumulate trinkets.

Long term, your goal is two-fold. You are hoping for a great legendary or mythic trinket drop. If you can't find one, then you'll eventually craft one.

If you do find one, or craft one, you'll need a lot of trinket fragments (thankfully these can be purchased on the market), so again, having more frequent drops over a longer time is the best way to get these upgraded.

> **New players!** Treasure Hunter Level 10 is about 5.6m gold, and then Level 20 is 31.6m gold. These should be early game goals. Equip whatever you find so you can get some immediate bonus.

## Buffs

| Rarity | Buff Amount |
| ---- | ---- |
| Rare | 3 |

## Finding Trinkets

### Actions

* Battling trinkets drop when battling.
* Gathering trinkets drop when gathering (mining, woodcutting, quarrying.)
* When crafting, you can find trinkets, but it is a 50-50 chance on it being battling/gathering.

### Trinket drop chance

* Land gives 1% drop chance per level
* Your active skill level
  * 1% per level below 100
  * 2% per level 100 and above
* Land Level (increase trinket drop chance)
* Personnel Levels (increase trinket drop chance)
* Personnel Levels Breakpoints for double trinket drop
  * 10% Chance at Treasure Hunter Level 50
  * 30% Chance at Treasure Hunter Level 75
  * 60% Chance at Treasure Hunter Level 100
  * 100% Chance at Treasure Hunter Level 150

## Destroying trinkets

Destroying a trinket will give you fragments and essence depending on rarity and tier.

### Fragments

Destroying fragments is the primary way of finding fragments, though some global bosses do drop them.

| Tier | Rare | Epic | Legendary | Mythic |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | --------- | ------ |
| T1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | ? |
| T2 | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| T3 | ? | ? | ? | ?
| T4 | 32 | ? | ? | ?
| T5 | ? | ? | ? | ?
| T6 | ? | 130 | 173 | ?
| T7 | ? | ? | ? | ?
| T8 |  - | ? | ? | ?
| T9 |  - | - | ? | ?
| T10 | - | - | - | ?

### Essence

Destroying trinkets provide essence. Currently, this is the only way to obtain essence.

| Rarity | Essence |
| ---- | ---- |
| Epic | 1 |
| Legendary | 5 |
| Mythical | ? |

## Rerolling trinkets

Costs are based on rarity. This re-rolls the base values of each buff currently on the trinket. It does **not** change which buffs are on a trinket. When you re-roll you will be given a choice to keep your original values or accept the re-roll value.

| Rarity | Fragments | Essence |
| ---- | ---- | --- |
| Epic | 10 | 1 |
| Legendary | 15 | 5 |
| Mythical | ? | ? |
