# Trinkets

`Inventory` &rarr; `Trinkets`

You can run one raid at a time. Raids progress even if you're offline. Raids cannot be paused. Cancelling them will have you lose your progress. Each land level has one scouted raid type associated with it.

> **New players** should try to get to a Village ( Level 3) to unlock the **Warehouse**, the 8-hour standard raid. You should always have a raid running. When you can, run **Scouted** raids before **Standard** raids.
