# Tools

Tool components are uncommon crafting components which drop from gathering, dungeons, raids, and Abyss special battle area. They are used to upgrade your tools (Pickaxe, Hatchet, Hammering).

> **New players!** Tool components are critical for gatherers. They can be expensive, but there are several ways to get them. New players should prioritize upgrading their tool to level 7 early on.

## How to use

Using tool components can be done on the `Home` or `Gathering` page, by clicking on the name of the tool.
